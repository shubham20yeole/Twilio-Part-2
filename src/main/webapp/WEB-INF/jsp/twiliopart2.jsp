	<p class="headingdis"><u>DESCRIPTION</u></p>
	1. Sending text messages has always been the easiest way for people to reach out anyone anytime. Many people prefer using SMS instead of calling. <br><br>
	2. Most common bussiness in Indian remote areas is farming which is very hard and time-consuming due to lack of technology. Hence, people can hardly pay much attention to their children's activities in school because of lack of time.<br><br>
	3. Secondly, as schools in villages are located at far distance from their home, it becomes second reason for people not having direct communication with their children class teachers.<br><br>
	4. Guardians play important role in the growth of their child. Many teachers encourage parents to keep attention about what their children are learning and keeping track of their progress reports.<br><br>
	5. EasySearch SMS service assists guardians to learn about their children progress reports at any time. This service can be also used to know school activities like events, new facilities and future development goals.<br><br>
